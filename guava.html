                The guava tree is a small, branching tree or shrub that typically grows to 3–10 meters (10–33 ft) tall. It has distinctive smooth, mottled, copper-colored bark that peels off in flakes. The leaves are oblong, leathery, and aromatic when crushed. The fruit is a berry, round or oval, with a green to yellow skin. The flesh inside can be white, yellow, or a deep pink, and contains many small, hard seeds.
