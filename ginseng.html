                What is Ginseng?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Ginseng is the common name for several species of slow-growing perennial plants with fleshy roots, belonging to the genus <em>Panax</em>. The most widely known are Asian Ginseng (<em>Panax ginseng</em>) and American Ginseng (<em>Panax quinquefolius</em>). The root is the most valuable part and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries as a powerful tonic.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Ginseng is a shade-loving woodland plant. It grows slowly, developing a single stem that bears a whorl of 3 to 5 compound leaves, each with several leaflets. It produces a small cluster of greenish-white flowers that mature into bright red berries. The root is fleshy, light-colored, and often forks, sometimes resembling a human figure (which is where its name, "rénshēn" or "man root," originates).

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Growing ginseng is extremely difficult and time-consuming, making wild ginseng incredibly expensive.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Needs a cool, temperate climate with cold winters.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Requires deep shade (70-90%), mimicking its natural woodland habitat.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Must have deep, rich, moist, and very well-drained soil, typically on a forested slope.</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> The roots are harvested only after 5-10 years of slow growth, which is why it is so valuable.</li>
