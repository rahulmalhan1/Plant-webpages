            </h2>

                Fenugreek is an annual plant in the family Fabaceae (pea family), with leaves consisting of three small leaflets. It is cultivated worldwide as a semi-arid crop. Both its leaves (as a herb, called "methi") and its seeds (as a spice) are used in cooking and traditional medicine. It is native to the Mediterranean region and Western Asia.

                The plant grows to about 2–3 feet (60–90 cm) tall. It has light green, trifoliate leaves (similar to clover). It produces small, white or yellowish-white flowers. The plant's most notable feature is its slender, curved, beige-to-yellowish-brown pods, which contain 10–20 small, hard, and aromatic seeds. The seeds are golden-amber, squarish, and have a distinct, slightly bitter, and mapley aroma.
