                What is an Olive Tree?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                The Olive (<em>Olea europaea</em>) is a small, evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean Basin. It is a plant of immense historical and cultural significance, having been cultivated for over 6,000 years. It is grown primarily for its fruit (olives), which are used to produce olive oil and are eaten as table olives. The olive branch is a powerful symbol of peace and victory.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Olive trees are known for their gnarled, twisted trunks, which become more pronounced with age. They are very slow-growing but can live for thousands of years. The leaves are silvery-green, slender, and oblong. The tree produces small, fragrant, whitish flowers, followed by the fruit (a drupe), which is green when unripe and turns dark purple or black when mature.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Key Uses:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> The most important product. Extra virgin olive oil, made from the first cold pressing, is a staple fat for cooking and dressing.</li>
                <li><strong>Table Olives:</strong> Raw olives are extremely bitter and must be cured (using brine, water, or lye) before they are edible.</li>
                <li><strong>Wood:</strong> The hard, dense wood is prized for its beautiful grain and is used to make high-end utensils and furniture.</li>
                <li><strong>Olive Leaf:</strong> Olive leaf extract is used as a health supplement, believed to have antioxidant and immune-supporting properties.</li>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Olive trees are legendary for their hardiness.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Requires a Mediterranean climate: hot, dry summers and mild, cool winters. They need a winter chill to set fruit but are damaged by hard freezes.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Needs full sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Must have excellent drainage. They thrive in rocky, poor soil where other crops would fail.</li>
                <li><strong>Drought-Tolerant:</strong> Once established, they are extremely drought-tolerant.</li>
