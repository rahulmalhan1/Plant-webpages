            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Gotu Kola is a low-growing, creeping plant. It has slender stems and small, rounded to fan-shaped green leaves with scalloped edges. It spreads by sending out runners (stolons) that root at the nodes. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white or pinkish-red flowers. It thrives in and around water and in moist, tropical climates.
