                What is Liquorice?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Liquorice (or licorice) is the root of <em>Glycyrrhiza glabra</em>, a herbaceous perennial legume native to Western Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe. The plant is prized for its sweet-tasting root, which is used as a flavoring in candy and beverages, and as a powerful herb in traditional medicine.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The liquorice plant grows to about 1-2 meters in height. It has feathery, pinnate leaves composed of 9â€“17 leaflets. The flowers are small, purplish-blue to pale white, and produced in clusters. The most valuable part is its extensive root system, which consists of a long, woody main taproot and many spreading runners (stolons).

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The sweetness of liquorice root comes from glycyrrhizin, a compound significantly sweeter than sugar.
