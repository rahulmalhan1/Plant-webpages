                What is Arjuna?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                The Arjuna (<em>Terminalia arjuna</em>) is a large, deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a highly revered plant in Ayurveda, where its bark has been used for thousands of years, primarily as a powerful tonic for cardiovascular health. It typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, forested areas.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The Arjuna tree can reach a height of 20-25 meters (about 80 feet). Its most distinctive feature is its smooth, thick, pinkish-grey or whitish bark, which peels off in large, thin sheets. It has oblong, dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely on the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers and fibrous, woody fruits with five prominent wings.
