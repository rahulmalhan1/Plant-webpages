                What is Sandalwood?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Sandalwood (<em>Santalum album</em>, or Indian Sandalwood) is a class of woods from trees in the genus <em>Santalum</em>. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. It is one of the most expensive woods in the world.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Indian Sandalwood is a small, evergreen tree that grows to about 4 to 9 meters (13 to 30 ft) in height. A unique characteristic of the tree is that it is a semi-parasite. Its roots form connections (haustoria) to the roots of other trees to draw water and some nutrients. The valuable, fragrant heartwood, which can take 15-30 years to develop, is found in the center of the trunk.
