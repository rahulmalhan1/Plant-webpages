                What is Tulsi?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Tulsi, also known as Holy Basil (Scientific name: <em>Ocimum tenuiflorum</em> or <em>Ocimum sanctum</em>), is an aromatic perennial plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is revered in Hinduism as a sacred plant with immense medicinal and spiritual value. Often referred to as the "Queen of Herbs," Tulsi is a cornerstone of Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine.
